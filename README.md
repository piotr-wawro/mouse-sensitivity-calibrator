## How to run
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/piotr-wawro/mouse-sensitivity-calibrator/releases)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Run MouseSensitivityCalibrator.exe

## How to use

#### Example
1. Set mouse movement in the source game
    * Run the game which has your desired sensitivity set
    * Start recording
    * Do a 360
    * Stop recording
    * Lock horizontal movement in the "Source game" section
    * Optionally repeat the steps for vertical movement
2. Set mouse movement in record 1 of target game (same steps as above)

   You probably didn't make it the first try, soo...

3. Change your sensitivity and repeat for record 2.

   Now you don't have to try third time, because you can calculate sensitivity

4. Click calculate

#### Things to note:
1. You can set data manually by clicking on the box and typing in values.
2. Remember to lock boxes when you're done with recording.
2. While calculating sensitivity assumption is made that it scales linearly.

## Configuration
#### Start and stop recording
You can set your own hotkeys for start and stop recording. Click with LMB on box to focus and press up to four modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt, win) plus one standard key. To remove hotkey press backspace or delete. To lose focus press escape.

#### Output type
If your mouse has 600 CPI (counts per inch) and you move it 1 inch, you will get 600 counts. Select conversion to translate CPI to cm or inches. 

#### Mouse CPI
Setting your mouse CPI is optional, as it isn't factored into calculations. It is used when converting counts to cm or inches.
